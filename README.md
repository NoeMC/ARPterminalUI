# ARPSpoofing Terminal User Interface

This is a program writen in python to kill the devices in your **LAN** network. It's very simple to use. This is the first version (1.0), therefore it has several bugs, don't worry, I will fix it. 

## ScreenShots

When the program is launched, you only need **scan**, select the target devices with the key **space** and finally kill them.
